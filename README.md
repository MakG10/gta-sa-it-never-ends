## About the mod
The story is an extension of GTA San Andreas, it begins right where original storyline ended. A short in-sight: Carl's brother, Sweet, has been kidnapped by a mafia led by Bill Degorio and now CJ is forced to work for them.

Mission pack GTA SA: It Never Ends is consisted of:
- 11 missions, 8 of which with voiced dialogues
- 8 unique jumps
- 8 money bags to collect
- Cover System
- Autosave mechanism

## About the code
Mission pack was written in SCM language using Sanny Builder as an IDE and compiler. CLEO library was used to make a mod as an extension to the game without overwriting existing files.

`src/CLEO/ine.txt` file is a starter script. It executed after loading a game and contains all necessary logic not directly related to missions. It handles progress information, creating mission markers when not on mission, events in between missions, collectable bags, in-game mod menu (after typing "inemenu") and so on.

`src/CLEO/INE` folder contains all mission files which compile tu Custom Mission files (.cm). They are called from `ine.cs` explained above.

`src/CLEO/INE/mission_includes.txt` file contains some functions shared across missions source codes.

`src/CLEO/INE/global_header.txt` file contains variable mappings for `ine.cs`

`src/CLEO/CLEO_TEXT` folder contains translated strings used in the scripts.
